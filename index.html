            Machine Learning for Service Life Prediction of Reinforced Concrete
            Structures: Advancing Carbonation Analysis and Sustainability
          </h1>
          <article class="resume">

              This project, developed by the Postgraduate Program in Civil
              Engineering (PPGEC) and Computing Department (DECOM) at Federal
              Center for Technological Education of Minas Gerais (CEFET-MG),
              aims to enhance the prediction of the durability of concrete
              structures, focusing on deterioration processes such as
              carbonation, through the application of machine learning
              techniques. The research combines artificial intelligence methods
              and the development of databases based on mathematical models to
              analyze the impact of material and environmental variables on
              structural degradation.
            </p>
            <p>
              By employing algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks, Random
              Forest, and Support Vector Regression, the project investigates
              methods to identify complex patterns and more accurately predict
              the progression of phenomena that affect structural integrity.
              Explainability tools, such as SHAP (SHapley Additive
              Explanations), are incorporated into the study to provide
              transparency and reliability to the results.
            </p>
            <p>
              With this approach, the project aims to contribute to the
              advancement of sustainable and efficient solutions in the
              planning, construction, and maintenance of concrete structures,
              supporting more informed and reliable decision-making in
              civil engineering.
