# 🏗️ Machine Learning for Concrete Carbonation Prediction

This project applies **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to predict the **service life of reinforced concrete structures exposed to carbonation**. With the growing concern for sustainability in construction, we aim to develop an intelligent model capable of analyzing multiple variables and providing accurate estimates of structural deterioration.

## 📌 Objectives
- Develop a **machine learning algorithm** to predict carbonation progression in concrete.
- Create a **database** with experimental and synthetic data on the phenomenon.
- Implement **explainability techniques** (SHAP) to understand the impact of each variable.
- Compare **Random Forest, Linear Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, scikit-learn, SHAP, numpy)
- **Machine Learning** (Random Forest, SVM, Linear Regression)
- **Data Analysis & Visualization** (matplotlib, seaborn)

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data collection and preprocessing** – Using experimental datasets and generating synthetic data.
2. **ML model training** – Implementing and comparing different techniques.
3. **Model explainability** – Using SHAP to identify the most influential factors.
4. **Validation and analysis** – Comparing results with real-world data and technical standards (NBR 6118:2023).

## 🎯 Expected Impact
- Improved accuracy in predicting **concrete service life** under carbonation effects.
- Development of a **decision-support tool** for civil engineers and researchers.
- **Reduction of environmental impact** through better planning of structural durability.
